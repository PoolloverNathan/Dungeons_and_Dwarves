[OBJECT:CREATURE]

So, Aboleths are going to be a super fun one to do, in part because they are possibly the perfect example of finding something you don't want to find when you dig too greedily and too deeply. Just imagine a bunch of mind-controlled and lubed-up dwarves turning on their brethren while the life force is sucked out of them to heal the giant rampaging monster slip'n'sliding through the cavernous halls of the Mountainhome. Sounds like !FUN!.

[CREATURE:ABOLETH]
	[DESCRIPTION:These creatures have the appearance of a squid with three eyes on the top of their head hanging over their gaping worm-like maw. Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their slaves. Aboleths have never forgotten.]
